Preventive effects of a standardized flavonoid extract of safflower in rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease rat model.Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that occurs after Alzheimer's disease. Rotenone is a neurotoxin commonly used in creating PD models. Safflower (Carthamus tinctoriusL.) contains some flavonoids that are effective against neurodegenerative diseases, and it has long been used in the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases in China. In this study, we investigated the preventive effect of safflower standardized flavonoid extract (SAFE) on a rotenone-induced PD rat model. The results showed that SAFE (17.5, 35, or 70\xe2\x80\xafmg\xc2\xb7kg
