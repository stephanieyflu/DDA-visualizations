Targeting Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress using Natural Products in Neurological Disorders.The primary aim of this review is to summarize the literature on natural products that are effective in the treatment of various neurological disorders by targeting endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Various electronic databases such as SCOPUS, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant publications. ERS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous neurological disorders such as cerebral ischemia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. Several natural products targeting ERS signalling pathways provide therapeutic options for neurological diseases, and in this review, the potential neuroprotective properties of these products are discussed.
